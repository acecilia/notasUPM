notasUPM
========
This is an iOS app for Universidad Politécnica de Madrid that allows you to login on moodle, check your grades (from politécnica virtual) and download and watch PDFs from moodle (also locally).
This app was developed with the only idea of learn how to code for iOS devices.
This app has been on the appStore for a while, but the authorities and informatics of UPM did not want it and we finally were forced to remove it under threats.
The code of this app may be dirty and unsafe, but, again, it was only code with the idea of learn.
